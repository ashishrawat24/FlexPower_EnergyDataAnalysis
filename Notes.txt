Background:

Task 1: A minimal reporting tool for a small trade database and expose them as an API
Task 2: Energy data analysis and build your own trading strategy


Task 1: Minimal reporting tool 

For example if the orderbook contains an order to sell 10 mw for 10 euros/mwh and another trader submits an order to buy 5 mw for 11 euros/mwh, the orders are matched by the exchange and a trade is generated for 5mw at 10 euros/mwh.

Note: Total six trades are made with strategy 1 and strategy 2 



Task 1.1 Write a function that computes the total buy volume and sell volume (include all strategy)

connect to the database (use MY SQL Data connector)
load the dataset
focus on side (buy and sell separately)
add all the buy and sell volume




Task 1.2 Write a function that computes the PnL (profit and loss) of each strategy in euros (separate the strategies) and return 0 if there is no trade

def a function of pnl
focus on strategy column 
identify various strategy like 1 and 2 so on by assigning startergy_id 

for all trades in the id column, (buy means negative values and sell means positive values and calculate income for each trade
then sum all incomes for each strategy 
if there is no trade then return 0 that correspond to the strategy id


Task 2: Data analysis and building a trading strategy

Import the datafile called "analysis_task_data.xlsx"



Task 2.1 Wind/PV Power was forecasted to produced in German in 2021 [in MWh] 

Considering conversion rate 0.25



Task 2.2 average Wind/Solar production for 2021 over a 24h period for Intraday and Day Ahead

conversion date time separately  
grouping by hour and calculating the avg



Task 2.3: Calculate the average value for Wind/PV using Day Ahead Forecasts and DA Prices

Extracting relevant columns
Average Value (EUR/MWh)= ∑(Power Forecast (MW)) \ ∑(Power Forecast (MW)×DA Price (EUR/MWh))
​


Task 2.4 - Identify Days with Highest & Lowest Renewable Production

convert daytime to date and time format
Renewable is wind + solar
grouping by day
min and max and identify the days 


Task 2.5 Average DA Price: Weekdays vs. Weekends

change into day time
identify weekdays and weekends (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
cal avg day ahead price


Task 2.6 Connecting Battery Storage and Calculating Revenue 

convert daytime to date and time format
grouping by day
Develop logic of charging battery at lowest price and discharging at highest for the day
Taking the AC by AC efficiency of 1 MWh battery system as 0.95 considering some system losses
